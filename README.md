# Creating Custom Reports in R using the VectorSurv API

This repository includes code for VectorSurv users to access their agency's data in R using the VectorSurv API and create reports using RMarkdown.

The code will be used for the VectorSurv R workshop on October 25th, 2023. During the workshop, VectorSurv users will earn how to access their agency's data in R using the VectorSurv API and create a report using RMarkdown. Prior experience with R or an understanding of the API is not required to benefit from the workshop. We will walk you through how to load your data and create a report using the pre-coded short sample report. The workshop will be recorded and posted on the [VectorSurv YouTube](youtube.com/@vectorsurv).

The repository includes [PDF documentation](https://github.com/UCD-DART/R-workshop/blob/main/VS_docs.pdf), a [source file]([VS_functions.R](https://github.com/UCD-DART/R-workshop/blob/main/VS_functions.R)) that includes all VectorSurv functions, a pre-coded [short sample report](https://github.com/UCD-DART/R-workshop/blob/main/SampleReport_short.Rmd) that users will run during the workshop, a pre-coded long sample report, and a [sample data set](https://github.com/UCD-DART/R-workshop/blob/main/sample_collections.csv) for users who have trouble accessing their data during the workshop. 

The PDF documentation explains how to access your data, filter and manipulate your data, and create tables and visualizations.
